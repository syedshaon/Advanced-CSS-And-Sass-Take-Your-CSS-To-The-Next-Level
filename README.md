To run the project make sure node is installed (thinking node module is not included)

In packaage json there are some dependency which can be installed by "npm install"

In index page css for old IE is yet to be written, also requires testing
In index page link to css is "css/styles.css" and another for "css/iconFont.css". I prefer VS's sass compiler but the "live-server" of npm is Great!
However our build process makes a minified  version after concating both. To have that run npm run build-css
